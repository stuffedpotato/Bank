###### This project is an assignment that I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class at Langara.

## Bank, BankAccount & BackTester

The Bank class utilizes the BankAccount class by creating an array list of BankAccount objects.  
I have also used Exceptions in this project if the user does not follow the restrictions, ex. balance after withdrawal is negative.

The user has the following options that allow testing of all available methods in the Bank/BankAccount class:
1. Add a new bank account.
2. Get balance of a bank account.
3. Deposit money to an existing bank account.
4. Withdraw money from an existing bank account.
5. Find the bank account with the highest balance.
6. Find the bank account with the lowest balance.
7. Print all bank accounts.

<code>scotia</code> is the object created of the Bank class and is used to manipulate the BankAccount objects.
